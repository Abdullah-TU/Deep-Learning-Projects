## Project: Emotion detection (FER-2013 dataset)

The dataset consists of 35,685 examples of gray-scale images of faces with dimensions of 48x48 pixels. These images are divided into a training dataset and a test dataset. The images are categorized based on the emotions depicted in the facial expressions. The emotion categories include:
- 🤗 Happiness
- 🧑 Neutral
- 😟 Sadness
- 😠 Anger
- 😯 Surprise
- 😑 Disgust
- 😨 Fear

Targets/labels: The target classes (the emotion categories)
Each class corresponds to a specific emotion category. The emotion categories include:
- 🤗 Happiness
- 🧑 Neutral
- 😟 Sadness
- 😠 Anger
- 😯 Surprise
- 😑 Disgusted
- 😨 Fear
  
- Features: The images
The images serve as the features or inputs to the model. These images contain visual information that the model will use to make predictions about the corresponding emotions.
the gray-scale images of faces with dimensions of 48x48 pixels. Each pixel in the image represents a feature value. The dataset consists of 35,685 examples of these images.

 Performance and accuracies:
 I explored various approaches to observe the outcomes and enhance the model's performance.
- Highest training accuracy : 78%
- Highest validation accuracy : 77%

# Project: Text-to-text translation
## Target of the project:
Our goal is to develop a deep learning model for translating different languages. However, our current focus is on English to Finnish translation.
